Easy Version Rules:
1. The CodeMaker, the "MasterMind", chooses a 4 color long ordered unique color code out of 8 possible unique colors.

2. The CodeBreaker, the user, states 4 unique, ordered colors that attempts to match the code. 

3. If the CodeBreaker states the correct position and color of the code the "MasterMind" will post a black peg for each match. If the user has stated a correct color then a white peg is posted.  Otherwise nothing is posted.

4. The user has ten turns to guess the code. 

Possible Advanced Rules:
#Only one peg exists for each color and black supercedes black.
