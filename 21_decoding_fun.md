Tonight we are going to do some rudimentary substitution cipher decoding!    

1. Quick run through rot13 (do a quick cipher with rot13.py)    

2. How far does a frequency analysis get us?    

3. Project night - How can we automate the human part of the process?    

4. Expanded problem - How can we generalize what we have learned to solve any substitution cipher?
