1. Lecture! - shut up and listen to what i have to say!! (25 min)     
    a. What have we been doing thus far and is that OOP?    
    b. Classes we've already been using

    d. Redefining or re-implementing int class    
    e. '__init__' constructor / factory, the pesky 'self'

    i. Is-a / Has-a verbage to describe object hierarchy    
    j. Disambiguation of terms: attributes, properties, methods, etc.        

2. Modeling the real world - what can we code up into our digital picnic basket? (45 min)    
    a. Why define a new class as opposed to assigning to a name of existing class?    
    b. Let's do that    
    c. Discussion: when to and when to not use classes    
    d. Advantages of user-defined class, advantages of digital v. real world object

    -classes are much like modules     
    -self is so the interpreter distinguish a class attribute from a local namespace
